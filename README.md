# Kia Ora, Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jian Wei Tay, the Biological Image Analysis Group Leader at the BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado Boulder. This page lists some of my personal projects, although the majority of my work is available at the following GitHub organizations:

* [BioFrontiers Advanced Light Microscopy Core](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC) - Code for various image analysis projects.
* [Bioimage Analysis Group](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysis) - Ongoing research projects and collaborations.

## Toolboxes for image analysis
* [BioFormats MATLAB](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/bioformats-matlab) - A (re)-implementation of a MATLAB class for the [BioFormats library](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/).
* [ND2 SDK Wrappers](https://github.com/jwtay1/nd2sdk-python) - Python implementation to read ND2 files using the official SDK.

## Current and Recent Projects
* [Tracking Cell Migration](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysis/tracking-cell-migration) - Tracking individual cells in scratch wound assays to develop models to understand the rules of life
* [VIABLE Virtual Biology Lab](https://github.com/project-viable/viable-virtual-lab) ([demo](https://project-viable.github.io/viable-virtual-lab/export/VirtualLabExport.html)) - Developing full simulations of biological experiments
* [Cypose: Fine-tuned models for cyanobacteria segmentation and classification](https://github.com/cameronlab/cypose)
* [Cell Mask Analyzer](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysis/cell-mask-analyzer) - Class to analyze masks and identify errors from ML models
* [CyAn: Cyanobacteria Image Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/CyAn) - A collection of code and scripts to study cyanobacteria
* [Cell Tracking Toolbox](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/cell-tracking-toolbox) - Written from scratch to track cells and identify division events

## Teaching Resources

### 2024
* [MCDB 6440](https://qoi-course.github.io/mcdb-6440/) - Python-based image analysis crash course

### 2020

## Side projects

### Websites
* [CU Boulder Hugo theme](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/hugo-theme-cuboulder) - Theme for the [ALMC website](https://advancedimaging.colorado.edu/) which I develop and maintain
* [Folio Hugo Theme](https://gitlab.com/jwtay/hugo-theme-folio) - A theme for my [personal website](https://jianweitay.com). Built primarily with Bootstrap.
* [Janssen Hugo theme](https://github.com/jwtay1/hugo-theme-janssen) - A theme for a documentation website, built from the ground up.

### Experiments
